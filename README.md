### Brief

1.  All the restful routes for your resource which should be working.
2. Your routes should be separated out into their own class
3. It should include all the relevant ERB templates for the routes that render HTML
4. At least two partials
5. A layout template
6. A new set of data in a static Model
7. Links to navigate around the CRUD actions on your site so you dont need to navigate via the url
8. Styling to make the site look good

### What I had difficulties with:
I had difficulties with getting the syntax correct and typos that took me a while to find.

### What went well:
I managed to get all the content on the pages working easily, with it all being linked from the controller.
